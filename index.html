                        <p class="small-paragraph">My first line of code has been written back in 2005, when my deskmate encouraged me to try out the C++ language. I started out by learning from an on-line course in order to participate in coding competitions, like "Olimpiada Informatyczna Gimnazjalistów" (Secondary School Olympic Games in Computer Science).</p>
                        <p class="small-paragraph">Unfortunately - the difference between what I was learning from the course and what my friend told me to do made me doubt the learning path that I have taken. The complexity of a language itself has made my doubts even more problematic and made me quit programming.</p>
                        <p class="small-paragraph">Several years later, during my college studies at Gdańsk University of Technology I was considered quite a good student in the field of Python programming during Bioinformatics course. I did my best to help my friends to pass the final exam and succeeded in helping at least some of them.</p>
                        <p class="small-paragraph">A few more years had to pass since I realized, that searching solutions to problems is what I really like to do.</p>
                        <p class="small-paragraph">Since then I am pursuing a new career in the field of software development and I have started college studies at Polish-Japanese Academy of Computer Science</p>
